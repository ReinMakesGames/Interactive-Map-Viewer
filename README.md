# Interactive-Map-Viewer

This Python-based program creates a mini, standalone version of the HoYoLab Interactive Map for Genshin Impact. It allows you to easily access and explore the map without needing to constantly switch between your game and browser windows. The program is designed to stay on top of all other applications, minimizing the need for alt-tabbing multiple times while playing the game.

## Key Features:
- Always-on-top Window: The embedded interactive map remains visible over other applications.
- Optimized for Gaming: To use this program, ensure that your game runs in borderless window mode. This will prevent genshin from minimizing when clicking inside tehe interactive map
